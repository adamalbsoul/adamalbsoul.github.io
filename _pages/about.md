I am a fresh graduate from Glasgow Caledonian University with a First Class BSc (Hons) degree in Computer Games Design.

Previously, I was a design intern at S&T Croatia and Taplingua where I learned about design and user research, worked at Pole To Win UK on a video game for a Fortune 500 client, and worked on plenty of design projects as a freelancer.

Check out [my UI designs](https://www.behance.net/adamalbsoul), or [my open source programming projects](https://github.com/adamalbsoul). Don't hesitate to [reach out](mailto:albsouladam@gmail.com) if you would like to work with me or just to say hi!
