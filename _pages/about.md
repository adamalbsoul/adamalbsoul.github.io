Hi! I'm Adam. I'm a Glasgow-based designer who's writing a dissertation at Glasgow Caledonian University to complete my Computer Games Design bachelor's honours degree. Previously, I was a design intern at S&T Croatia and Learned about UX and user research strategies, worked at Pole To Win UK on a high profile video game, and worked on plenty of design projects as a freelancer.

Check out [my designs](https://www.behance.net/adamalbsoul), or [my open source programming projects](https://github.com/oreoadidas). Don't hesitate to [reach out](mailto:albsouladam@gmail.com) if you would like to work with me or just to say hi!
