Balls to the Walls” is a turn based combat local multiplayer game. The game borrows mechanics from cue sports and plays like a snooker game but with reimagined innovative features; the balls themselves are characters, they each have stats such as health and attack points. To control the balls on their team, players will use a mouse to pull back and aim before releasing for a shot. The balls can ricochet off walls, traps, opponents and each other. When hitting an opponent’s ball, that ball will lose health points, however the player will need to be careful, because if they hit a trap they’ll lose health. Each player will have one turn per round, before switching over to the second player.
