Balls to the Walls is a turn based combat local multiplayer game.

## Project Description
The spec sheet of the assignment required us to make a video game with these requirements: 

- Local multiplayer based (2 or more players in the same room playing on same computer)
- Should be unique, weird or wacky. Try to do something that has never been done before!
- Theming of game should be tied to your target audience (you need to figure out who this would be)
- 
The game borrows mechanics from cue sports and plays like a snooker game but with reimagined innovative features; the balls themselves are characters, they each have stats such as health and attack points. To control the balls on their team, players will use a mouse to pull back and aim before releasing for a shot. The balls can ricochet off walls, traps, opponents and each other. When hitting an opponent’s ball, that ball will lose health points, however the player will need to be careful, because if they hit a trap they’ll lose health. Each player will have one turn per round, before switching over to the second player.
