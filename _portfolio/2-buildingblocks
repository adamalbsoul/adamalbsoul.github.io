Visual Novel was decided as the genre for the video game as this genre helps focus on the story by aiding a text-based story with illustrations. Unity was the game engine used to make this game and a plugin called Fungus was used to aid in making the Visual Novel aspect of the game.<br/>

### Interactivity
To further the interactivity of the game, puzzle minigames were added during appropriate timings in the game in an effort to preserve ludonarrative consistency. The dialogue in the narrative side responds to the win or lose outcome of the puzzle.<br/>

### Plot

The story for the game revolves around Lego minifigures and the owner of the Lego minifigures. The issues faced by transgendered people and those suffering from body dysmorphia and to spread awareness about them is the focus of the story. A reference to real world issues such as overly authoritative figures, that impact society negatively instead of positively as they are supposed to, is also made. <br/>

### Misc
The artwork used for this project was open-licensed and free to use as the team does not consist of anyone specialized in art. During the development of the game, playtests were conducted which gave positive feedback. The feedbacks given were used to develop the game to an acceptable and finished product. <br/>
