The development process, playtesting reports, and decisions made between iterations of a single-player level “San Francisco noire-ish”. Version 4.21 of Unreal Engine 4 was used for the level.

The level is set at night time in the Tenderloin neighbourhood of San Francisco. It was the most violent part of the city in the 1990s. It is known for its trans and non-normative gender community as well. 

### End-user analysis
The end-user should be familiar with FPS genre games. The user is supposed to have an understanding of FPS shooter mechanics, stealth mechanics, and puzzles.

### Design constraints
The level had to be constructed with the assets that were provided with the coursework. Many of these could not be used for the 90’s San Francisco aesthetic. The time that the level had to be completed was achieved by manipulating the level size as well as placing evidence markers which would make the player stop and discover pieces of information in form of text which would prolong the time played.
