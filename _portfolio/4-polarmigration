Made for a design brief set by Rare & Xbox Game Studios - "Create a game thatâ€™s a force for good".

Meet Polly the polar bear, the main character of Polar Migration. The player controls Polly to move north to reach safe habitats.

Polly is on a race against time as the ice cap platforms will be sinking upon landing and moving while the player traverses to the endpoint. There are also obstacles such as human-made litter that slow Polly down. Polar bear food like seals gives Polly a temporary movement boost.

After a run the player will participate in online activism for the hashtag #polarmigration to reach virality for it and its goals to be noticed.
