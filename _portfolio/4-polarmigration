Polar Migration is a campaign for spreading awareness about the loss of polar bears’ habitat due to global warming that included a game concept, trailer video, and promotional website. The brief was set by Rare & Xbox Game Studios - 'Create a game that is a force for good’.

The decision was that the player controls Polly the polar bear to move north to reach safe habitats. After a run the player will participate in online activism for the hashtag #polarmigration to reach virality for it and its goals to be noticed.

Creating the game was at the core of the campaign. It was decided that the game concept will include an animation of what the game should look like, a ‘vertical slice’. The engine used was Unity for its ease of use, especially for animations using the timeline feature. Mixamo was used for creating the animations.
